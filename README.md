# money-exchange-simulation
 A Python project simulating a money exchange game. Participants start with an initial amount and randomly give money to each other over a specified number of transactions. The simulation tracks changes in money distribution, visualizes results through charts and animations, and saves the final outcomes in a CSV file.
